      <h2>In loving memory of Philip Toube, fondly known as Oupie</h2>
      <p>
        Rainbow Products was born from the heart of a man who simply wanted to help-first his family, and then the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Philip Toube, known lovingly by those closest to him as ‚ÄúOupie,‚Äù wasn't just a pharmacist. He was a father, a grandfather, and a gentle soul with an unshakable belief that nature holds the answers to so many of life's challenges-especially the ones that keep tired moms up at night.
      </p>
      <p>
        Phil earned his BSc in Pharmacy at the University of Pretoria (Tukkies), where he combined scientific rigor with a growing interest in alternative, more holistic remedies. But it wasn't until he became a grandfather that his passion truly found its purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watching his own grandchildren struggle through the pain of teething-and seeing the exhaustion in the eyes of the moms around him-Phil was inspired to do something. He began working on formulas in his own time, determined to create a natural, gentle, and effective solution that parents could trust. What started as a personal mission grew into something far bigger: the founding of Rainbow Products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Phil's motto was simple: Happy baby, happy mommy. And that guiding principle is still at the heart of everything Rainbow does. His formulations, including the now-beloved teething powders and gels, were always created with care, backed by science, and rooted in love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Rainbow Products stands as a tribute to Phil's vision-a legacy of comfort, trust, and a little bit of magic for families everywhere. His dream was never to build an empire; it was to make life a little easier for moms, and a little more comfortable for babies. And in doing so, he left a rainbow of hope and healing that continues to shine.
